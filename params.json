Do One Thing and Do It Well. There's an accompanying rubygem that will add all the smart stuff like advanced gesture recognition, events, etc.\r\n\r\n## USAGE\r\n\r\n    % kinectable_pipe | ruby some_other_script.rb\r\n\r\n## INSTALLATION (OS X / homebrew)\r\n\r\n    # must have universal binary for libusb\r\n    brew uninstall libusb\r\n    brew install libusb --universal\r\n\r\n    brew tap marshally/alt\r\n\r\n    brew install kinectable_pipe\r\n    \r\n    # now plug in your kinect\r\n    # and run this command in the terminal\r\n    \r\n    kinectable_pipe\r\n    \r\n    # step back from the sensor, wave your arms like a lunatic\r\n    # until it recognizes you and starts pumping out skeleton data\r\n    # to STDOUT\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n1. Recognize all available `xn::GestureGenerator`\r\n1. Fix output to work with non-interactive terminal sessions.\r\n1. Add CLI argument `-r` to change output framerate.\r\n1. Improve Ruby sample app.\r\n1. Add sample apps for other scripting languages.\r\n1. Add CLI argument for alternate output encodings (XML, msgpack, BERT, whatever).\r\n"}
