# kinectable_pipe

kinectable_pipe is a command-line utility that dumps user skeleton data from a Microsoft Kinect device to a standard Unix pipe.

### Why?

To bring Unix-y goodness to the world of Microsoft Kinect programming!

### No, really, why?

Because Kinect programming is a pain in the neck, and by trivializing the device's output into a simple text format, it becomes infinitely easier to digest in the scripting language of your choice.

## USAGE

    % kinectable_pipe -r 30
